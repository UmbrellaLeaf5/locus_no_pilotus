## Description

In this project, we are developing an application that calculates the trajectory of a flying delivery robot that collects valuable cargo from control points: **Targets**. 
On its way, it may encounter high mountains that it cannot fly over: **Hills**; or elliptical territories that are impossible to visit due to climate conditions: **TrappyCircles**. 
Also, through some control points, the robot is simply unable to move, as the cargo may not be ready for transportation at that time, these are **TrappyLines**. 

The robot's trajectory is calculated using several mathematical algorithms: [...]. 
The graphical interface for constructing the trajectory was created using [Qt](#used-libs-and-sources) and [QCustomPlot](#used-libs-and-sources). 

In the application, you can add objects using window forms, interact with the trajectory calculation plot using the mouse cursor, create and open files in ```.json``` format with a specific style for this application. Editing objects can also be done with cursors or using a special dynamic input field with tables, opened in a separate window mode or embedded in the main one. 

*We strongly recommend that you install our application using the instructions below and try it out!*

## Installation and configuring

#### On Windows 64 bit system
1) Install **[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)** to any convenient folder as compiler setup
> *P.S. of course you can try install all the libs and packages used in repo manually, but our team got pain and tears trying to install Boost on MINGW in this way, so we recommend to install MSYS (besides, it is an excellent tool for compiling any other C++ and etc. projects)*

2) Open ```MSYS2 MSYS``` console, copy the command below and paste it with ```Shift+Ins``` or ```RBM and 'Paste'``` to download all the packages used in our project
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
pacman -U https://mirror.msys2.org/mingw/mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-qt-creator-13.0.1-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-boost
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang
```

3) Install **[Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)** to any convenient folder (if you haven't get it yet) 

4) Open ```Git Bash``` and use command like ```cd C:/CodeFolder``` to go to the folder where you usually save the code

5) Clone our repo with including submodules to such folder:
``` 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/UmbrellaLeaf5/locus_no_pilotus 
```

6) Open the MSYS bin folder in path like ```C:\YourPathToMsys\msys64\mingw64\bin``` than find and start ```qtcreator.exe```

7) In folder with our project clone find ***CMakeLists.txt*** and open it with QtCreator

8) Set the compiler that allow *CMake* configuration in the kits list and click ```Configure Project```

9) To use the full working version: **Build** (hammer button in the lower left corner) the project, and after ending process with error use ***Build > Run CMake*** in the top menu to reconfigure and fix error with including QCustomPlot
> *P.S. because of using QCustomPlot, we need to copy additional .lib file to build directory, and our script does this when activating the Run CMake command*

10) Now you can use full working project with **Run** (green triangle button in the lower left corner)!

#### On Linux system

*Coming soon...*

> Much respect and help for this installation method to [George Sukhanov](https://github.com/TheFueRr "our colleague with an equally interesting project on processing experimental data")!

## Used libs and sources
